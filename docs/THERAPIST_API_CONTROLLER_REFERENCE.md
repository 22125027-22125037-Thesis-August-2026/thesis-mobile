# API Controller Reference

Swagger-style, human-readable API reference for `therapist-api` controllers.

## Base URL

- Local default: `http://localhost:8082`
- Production/staging: use the deployed host for that environment.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require JWT bearer authentication.

- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- Security rule:
- `/api/v1/test/**` is public (no auth required)
- `/api/v1/**` requires authentication
- Role checks:
- Some endpoints additionally require `ROLE_PATIENT` or `ROLE_THERAPIST`

JWT claim usage in this API:

- Principal ID comes from `profileId` claim, or falls back to JWT `sub`
- Role comes from `role` claim and is normalized to `ROLE_*`

Profile-scoped authorization pattern used in controllers:

- `@PreAuthorize("#profileId.toString() == authentication.name or hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")`
- Meaning: allow when caller is the same profile (`self`) or has `ROLE_ADMIN`.

## Common Error Response Format

Errors are returned as RFC 7807 `ProblemDetail` JSON.

- Auth: Required
- Description: Books a slot and creates an appointment. New optional fields:
  `reason` (free-text patient-stated reason, max 1000 chars) and `mode`
  (`VIDEO` default, `TEXT` allowed).

Request body:

```json
{
  "slotId": "9b3ea8e0-7eaf-4b9f-a72e-932c9ce0e0d6",

  (→ `CANCELLED`, slot released).

  `POST /api/v1/bookings/{id}/cancel`.

```

### 25. Patient Matching Preferences (therapist read)

### 26. Patient Tags + Risk Level

  "updatedBy": "5f2afc57-d6e4-4dd4-a2f2-34b2520ff31f"
}
```

Risk-level response is the same shape with `riskLevel` instead of `tags`.

### 27. Rich Clinical Notes (SOAP + risk flags + drafts)

`POST /api/v1/notes` now accepts the full SOAP shape plus risk flags and an
optional `status`. Default `status` is `FINALIZED` for back-compat.

Request body:

```json
{
  "appointmentId": "76d7800a-ae23-4f65-9d3d-c9536e2bdf5a",
  "diagnosis": "Moderate anxiety",
  "recommendations": "Weekly CBT for 8 weeks",
  "subjective": "Patient reports trouble sleeping...",
  "objective": "Anxious affect, restlessness observed",
  "assessment": "F41.1 Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
  "plan": "CBT sessions, sleep hygiene exercises",
  "summary": "Anxiety w/ sleep impact — CBT plan",
  "riskSuicidalIdeation": false,
  "riskSelfHarm": false,
  "riskSubstanceUse": false,
  "riskAbuse": false,
  "status": "DRAFT"
}
```

- `status: "DRAFT"` does NOT flip the appointment to `COMPLETED`. Drafts only
  allowed when the appointment is `UPCOMING` or `IN_PROGRESS`.
- `status: "FINALIZED"` keeps the original semantics: appointment must be
  `IN_PROGRESS` and is transitioned to `COMPLETED`.

Lifecycle endpoints:

- `PUT  /api/v1/notes/{noteId}` — amend a draft (FINALIZED notes are read-only).
- `POST /api/v1/notes/{noteId}/finalize` — transition draft → FINALIZED and
  flip the appointment to `COMPLETED` if it is still `IN_PROGRESS`.
- `GET  /api/v1/notes/{noteId}` — fetch by note id.
- `GET  /api/v1/notes/appointments/{appointmentId}` — fetch by appointment.
- `GET  /api/v1/notes?therapistId=&patientId=&status=&page=&size=` — list
  (therapist callers are always scoped to their own notes regardless of the
  `therapistId` query param).

Note detail response:

```json
{
  "noteId": "2eb65f39-7da4-4ca4-9820-e9c412084d45",
  "appointmentId": "76d7800a-ae23-4f65-9d3d-c9536e2bdf5a",
  "profileId": "76d7800a-ae23-4f65-9d3d-c9536e2bdf5a",
  "therapistId": "5f2afc57-d6e4-4dd4-a2f2-34b2520ff31f",
  "appointmentStatus": "COMPLETED",
  "status": "FINALIZED",
  "diagnosis": "Moderate anxiety",
  "recommendations": "Weekly CBT for 8 weeks",
  "subjective": "...",
  "objective": "...",
  "assessment": "...",
  "plan": "...",
  "summary": "Anxiety w/ sleep impact — CBT plan",
  "riskFlags": {
    "suicidalIdeation": false,
    "selfHarm": false,
    "substanceUse": false,
    "abuse": false
  },
  "createdAt": "2026-04-15T07:35:21.913Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-04-15T07:40:03.011Z"
}
```

### 28. Therapist Dashboard Summary

- Method/Path: `GET /api/v1/therapists/{therapistId}/dashboard/summary`
- Auth: Required
- Authorization: `self` or `ROLE_ADMIN`.

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "activePatientCount": 12,
  "completedThisMonth": 23,
  "averageRating": 4.85,
  "pendingBookingCount": 2,
  "draftNoteCount": 1,
  "moodAlertCount": 0
}
```

`moodAlertCount` is owned by the Tracking Service and is currently returned
as `0` from the therapist-api until the cross-service `/alerts` endpoint is
wired in.

## Appointment status lifecycle

```
REQUESTED ──confirm──▶ UPCOMING ──join──▶ IN_PROGRESS ──submit note (FINALIZED)──▶ COMPLETED
    │                     │                      │
    └──reject──▶ CANCELLED └──cancel──▶ CANCELLED └──cancel──▶ CANCELLED
```

- New patient bookings via `POST /api/v1/bookings` start in `REQUESTED`. The
  therapist must call `/confirm` (→ `UPCOMING`) or `/reject` (→ `CANCELLED`).
- The `/profiles/{id}/appointments/upcoming` endpoint includes `REQUESTED`,
  `UPCOMING`, and `IN_PROGRESS` so the patient's "next appointment" view
  surfaces pending requests too.
- Cancellations (patient or therapist) always release the originating slot so
  it can be re-booked.
