# API Controller Reference

Swagger-style, human-readable API reference for `therapist-api` controllers.

## Base URL

- Local default: `http://localhost:8082`
- Production/staging: use the deployed host for that environment.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require JWT bearer authentication.

- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- Security rule:
- `/api/v1/test/**` is public (no auth required)
- `/api/v1/**` requires authentication
- Role checks:
- Some endpoints additionally require `ROLE_PATIENT` or `ROLE_THERAPIST`

JWT claim usage in this API:

- Principal ID comes from `profileId` claim, or falls back to JWT `sub`
- Role comes from `role` claim and is normalized to `ROLE_*`

Profile-scoped authorization pattern used in controllers:

- `@PreAuthorize("#profileId.toString() == authentication.name or hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")`
- Meaning: allow when caller is the same profile (`self`) or has `ROLE_ADMIN`.

## Common Error Response Format

Errors are returned as RFC 7807 `ProblemDetail` JSON.
